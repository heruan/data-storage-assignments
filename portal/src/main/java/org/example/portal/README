Your task: Create a saga that is used by contact tracers when they are in touch with a new client for the first time.
The saga should make sure that the client's personal information are available in the Patient Records app, and that
there is an entry for the person in the Contact Tracing app. Finally, an e-mail message should be sent to the client,
confirming that the records have been created (some kind of a receipt I guess).

Feel free to change the APIs as needed and simulate/mock everything that is irrelevant to the completion of this task.
